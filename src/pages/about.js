    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      I love a good old fashioned adventure and tend to gravitate towards wild places, which you can read more about here. There's something very rewarding about spending weeks in an environment and getting to know the ins and outs of the weather, the wildlife and the landscape. I started taking photos during my adventures and have not looked back since. I run a production company in Sydney, Australia and shoot medium format and 4x5 film locally and any wild place I find myself. Large format photography forces me to slow down and really consider every shot carefully. Hand processing each negative in the darkroom is something I find both thrilling and terrifying but when the stars align, can produce images I am truely proud of.
