There's something very rewarding about spending weeks in an environment and getting to know the ins and outs of the weather, the wildlife and the landscape. I started taking photos during my adventures and have not looked back since.

Large format photography forces me to slow down and really consider every shot carefully. Hand processing each negative in the darkroom is something I find both thrilling and terrifying but when the stars align, can produce images I am truely proud of."))},e.exports=r.default}});
