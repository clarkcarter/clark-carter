There's something very rewarding about spending weeks in an environment and getting to know the ins and outs of the weather, the wildlife and the landscape. I started taking photos during my adventures and have not looked back since. I run a production company in Sydney, Australia and shoot medium format and 4x5 film locally and any wild place I find myself. Large format photography forces me to slow down and really consider every shot carefully. Hand processing each negative in the darkroom is something I find both thrilling and terrifying but when the stars align, can produce images I am truely proud of."))},e.exports=n.default}});
